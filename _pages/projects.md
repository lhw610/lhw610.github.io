# Projects

## Transfer Function
R&D Project, Allen Institute for Cell Science
- Computational model that transfers 3D microscopic images between different magnification, different
microscopic object, different resolution, and different light microscope modalities.
- Collaborated with scientists to develop a deep learning based open source toolkit, transfer function, where
conditional GAN is used as a backend with pytorch.
- Designed extensive validation tests to validate feasibility of the transfer function in R&D stage.
