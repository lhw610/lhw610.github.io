# About me

I'm a full-time **Computer Vision Engineer** at [Allen Institute for Cell Science](https://alleninstitute.org/what-we-do/cell-science/) in Seattle, since July 2019.
---

*I work on research problems in computer vision, deep learning, and statistical analysis. At Allen Institute, I am developing open source tools for microscopic cell image analysis such as **[Allen Cell Structure Segmenter](https://www.allencell.org/segmenter.html)**. As a member of Assay Development Team, I design an algorithms to process and analyze quantitative information from biological data. This includes algorithm design, feasibility test, and pipeline implementation*

## Previous research experiences

- **Machine Learning Research Assistant** - Cornell University:  
  I worked as a graudate research asssitant at **[Sabuncu Labs](http://sabuncu.engineering.cornell.edu/)**. I worked on 3D brain MR image segmentation using resgistration. I developed a multi-atlas segmentation (MAS) with semi-supervised learning based registration which improves on existing MAS methods. Our work is accepted to NeurIPS 2019 workshop ML4H **[Few Labeled Atlases are Necessary for Deep-Learning-Based Segmentation](https://arxiv.org/abs/1908.04466).

- **Medical Image Analysis Research Assistant** - University of Rochester:  
  I worked as a undergraduated research asssitant at **[Wismueller Labs](https://www.urmc.rochester.edu/labs/wismueller.aspx)**. I worked on brain tumor segmentation from MR images using unsupervised clustering and conditional random field.
