# About me

I'm a full-time **Associate Scientist, Ultrasound Applications** at **Philips Reseach North Amercia** in Cambridge since July 2020.
---

*I work on research problems in computer vision, deep learning, and statistical analysis for ultrasound applications.*

## Previous work experiences
- **Scientific Data Engineer** - Allen Institute for Cell Science:
  *July 2019 - July 2020*<br />
  At Allen Institute, I developed an open source tools for microscopic cell image analysis such as **[Allen Cell Structure Segmenter](https://www.allencell.org/segmenter.html)**. As a member of Assay Development Team, I design an algorithms to process and analyze quantitative information from biological data. This includes algorithm design, feasibility test, and pipeline implementation.
